display_all(
  n,
  sequential = FALSE,
  colorblind_only = FALSE,
  direction = 1,
  override.order = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of requested colors. If n is left blank, default palette is returned.}

\item{sequential}{Should palettes displayed all at once, or one at a time. Default is all at once (FALSE).}

\item{colorblind_only}{Should only colorblind friendly palettes be returned? Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{direction}{Sets order of colors. Default palette is 1. If direction is -1, palette color order is reversed}

\item{override.order}{Colors are picked from palette to maximize readability and aesthetics. This means

colors are selected in sequential order from the full palette instead. Default is FALSE.}
